			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The choice of charity for a website design is Pets for Life Animal Shelter, a non-profit organisation that deals in the rehabilitation of stray cats in Billinudgel in NSW. Annually re-homing over 100 cats and kittens in Byron Shire, they are a non-euthanising shelter, micro-chipping, vaccinating and de-sexing strays upon admission and ready for foster or adoption care. The shelter operates on volunteer work, and relies on the donations from patrons for maintenance and care.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Like most not-for-profit organisations (NFP), it faces funding and awareness issues. This results in higher fees for adoption of stray cats.The advent of COVID19 also has not helped, putting a halt to many NFP schemes. (Kelloway, 2020) Conventional methods of fundraising like physical meetups, bake sales, second hand good events are cancelled, in favor of virtual alternatives that limit physical contact. <br></br>
Thus, creating a website for Pets for Life Animal Shelter offers an interesting opportunity to unite the cat owning community together. With a community portal website, users can meet and make friends with fellow owners through the interaction of their pets profiles, whilst the NFP can manage donations and community engagement through one social channel. An online portal allows opportunities for virtual fundraisers encouraging users to donate to the shelter, even during situations like a pandemic.

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>From a glance, the Facebook page of Pets for Life Animal Shelter has a community that consists of mostly active female users of causcasian descent, aged from middle-aged to early elderly. Some users already had owned pets, showing an inclination towards owning animals. In addition, some of the users were self-employed or had their own businesses. <br></br>
The Billinudgel census of 2016 showed that the median age of the town was 47, with nearly 41% of inhabitants being in the age bracket 40 - 70 years of age (ABS 2016). The following info was compiled with the analysis of the aforementioned information.</p>

			<p>The initial design for the community portal had an interface similar to social media networks like Facebook. According to a survey of statista showed that 68% of U.S. Baby Boomer adults ( ages 50 - 64 ) used Facebook as of June 2019. As this demographic covers most of our user profiles, it would be ideal to design a portal with a similar layout for users to adapt to a familiar interface.  </p>

      <p> The following images illustrate a proposed look for the website portal. A simple, minimalistic look with fewer buttons would allow for an easier, intutive navigation experience our proposed users. (Berman, Grossman, Scardino, Mickelson & Shamosh, 2017)

			<p>Wireframing the website was the next step to realise the community portal.</p>

			<p>Wireframing was beneficial in the ideation process as it expanded on the conceptual sketches, and helped visualisation on a digital platform. (Tomitsch M. et.al, 2018)</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The choice of charity for a website design is Pets for Life Animal Shelter, a non-profit organisation that deals in the rehabilitation of stray cats in Billinudgel in NSW. Annually re-homing over 100 cats and kittens in Byron Shire, they are a non-euthanising shelter, micro-chipping, vaccinating and de-sexing strays upon admission and ready for foster or adoption care. The shelter operates on volunteer work, and relies on the donations from patrons for maintenance and care.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Like most not-for-profit organisations (NFP), it faces funding and awareness issues. This results in higher fees for adoption of stray cats.The advent of COVID19 also has not helped, putting a halt to many NFP schemes. (Kelloway, 2020) Conventional methods of fundraising like physical meetups, bake sales, second hand good events are cancelled, in favor of virtual alternatives that limit physical contact. <br></br>
Thus, creating a website for Pets for Life Animal Shelter offers an interesting opportunity to unite the cat owning community together. With a community portal website, users can meet and make friends with fellow owners through the interaction of their pets profiles, whilst the NFP can manage donations and community engagement through one social channel. An online portal allows opportunities for virtual fundraisers encouraging users to donate to the shelter, even during situations like a pandemic.

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>From a glance, the Facebook page of Pets for Life Animal Shelter has a community that consists of mostly active female users of causcasian descent, aged from middle-aged to early elderly. Some users already had owned pets, showing an inclination towards owning animals. In addition, some of the users were self-employed or had their own businesses. <br></br>
The Billinudgel census of 2016 showed that the median age of the town was 47, with nearly 41% of inhabitants being in the age bracket 40 - 70 years of age (ABS 2016). The following info was compiled with the analysis of the aforementioned information.</p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>Ideation started with planning out the architechture of the website. Navigation of the community portal started with planning out the sitemap. </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HOME</strong>
        <br></br>
        Home functions similarly to a landing page, where users can access information relating to the organisation, donate and login/sign up to the website community portal.
        <br></br>
        <strong>ABOUT US</strong>
        <br></br>
	      The About Us tab contains contact information, history of the shelter and a google map for users to be guided to the shelter for physical visits. Users can also find social media links and a link to the main website.
        <br></br>
        <strong>DONATE</strong>
        <br></br>
        The Donate tab allows users to access different methods of donating:
        <ul>
	        <li> ONE TIME 
          <li> RECURRING
        </ul>
        Each selection will bring users to a donation form where they can fill out with their details and donate to the shelter.
        <br></br>
        <strong>LOGIN/SIGNUP</strong>
        <br></br>
        The Login/signup screen leads users to login or sign up to the community portal. The login/signup forms on the screen are interchangable for both site visitors and users to interact with.
        <br></br>
	      <strong>USER PROFILE HOME</strong>
        <br></br>
        <ul>
	        <li> CAT PROFILE
            <br></br>
            Profile at the side of the page will display info of the user's cat including information like 
            <ul>
              <li> Name
              <li> Birthday
              <li> Type of Cat
              <li> Pictures and Videos of Cat
              <li> Owner Name
            </ul>
            <br></br>
          <li> NEWS FEED
            <br></br>
          In the middle of the page will be a scrollable feed where users can view and interact with posts by other users friended or the shelter.
            <br></br>
          <li> FIND MY FURRY FRIENDS
          <br></br>
          A search bar exists on the right side of the screen, where users can look up owners and their cats to connect with and follow. Users can also follow users who are biologically related to their cat.
          <br></br>
          <li> FURRY FRIENDS
          <br></br>
          Under the search bar box exists a list that users have connected with to message. 
        </ul>
        <strong>FIND MY FRIENDS</strong>
        <br></br>
        Once the user has searched up a cat or user, they will be navigated to a page of list of searches where they can connect with various users.
        <br></br>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>The initial design for the community portal had an interface similar to social media networks like Facebook. According to a survey of statista showed that 68% of U.S. Baby Boomer adults ( ages 50 - 64 ) used Facebook as of June 2019. As this demographic covers most of our user profiles, it would be ideal to design a portal with a similar layout for users to adapt to a familiar interface.  </p>

      <p> The following images illustrate a proposed look for the website portal. A simple, minimalistic look with fewer buttons would allow for an easier, intutive navigation experience our proposed users. (Berman, Grossman, Scardino, Mickelson & Shamosh, 2017)

			<p>Wireframing the website was the next step to realise the community portal.</p>

			<h2>RATIONALE</h2>
			<p>
        The final prototype of the website was first formed when feedback was given on the proposal, on the design of the intended website, depth of research and user profiles. Unfortunately, the proposal was not diverse enough, in exploring one singular design and not multiple different designs. Additionally, there was a flaw in the user profiles. The information in the profiles was not sufficient enough to draw conclusions from as there could have been more information about the users that could be found, to graph additional user frustrations.<br>
This gave me a chance to explore more direct approaches to different audiences that have not been addressed during the research phase.
<br></br>
In evaluating the current design, the aim of the website was shifted from a focus of generating a community portal to a call-to-action page for young users to sign up for volunteering in an easier fashion than it is currently.
<br></br>
      </p>
			<h3 id="considerations">CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
			<p>
This website was created with a few extra considerations, due to a change in targeting a new group of users, as well as improving upon the current design, aiming to communicate over a more responsive, attractive and user-centered design.
<br></br>
Our new target users to be included to use the website included Gen Z users. Seeing from the most active social page: Pets for Life - Facebook, analysis of the page showed that there was a lack of user engagement in users aged under 30. In addition, the facebook page did not provide clear ways the audience could interact with the organisation, whether for it to be mobilising their users to donate more or volunteer at the shelter. 
<br></br>
Generation Z are drawn to investing themselves into experiences, meaning in order mobilize younger users to more involved into an organisation requires the organisation to  market experiences where users can learn, interact, engage, and “come away with that experience with something in-hand”(inphantry, 2020), to have enriched their own interpersonal values and “bettered themselves” from that experience. In addition, Gadimova (2020), suggests that younger audiences are drawn to organisations that  not only live out their values authentically but also enable the users to live out their own values. Focusing on volunteering at an animal shelter appeals to the hero side of users, and was a step in the right direction in creating a clearer purpose for the website to have.

			<h3 id="mobile">MOBILE OPTIMISATION</h3>
			<p>
        According to Deloitte’s Mobile Consumer Survey of 2019, Smartphone penetration had reached from 76% to 91% of Australians. It can be assumed from this statistic that mobile optimisation is an extremely important aspect in designing for users. The site was optimised for mobile usage making sure that important pieces of information were formatted correctly for users to scroll through, read and use.

			<h2>STRUCTURE</h2>

      <h3 id="home">HOME</h3>
      <figure>
				<img src="IMAGES/WEB/index1.PNG" alt="ABOUT"/>   
        <figcaption>An Overview of the Website Home</figcaption>
      </figure>
          The home/index page is where most users will be directed after clicking an advertisement for volunteering. It features a banner area where users can be instantly led to the volunteering page when they interact with the button.
          Under the banner exists an area that highlights the shelter’s three biggest values they stand for and what the shelter provides. Users can associate and identify similar values the shelter may have with their own values and is a major draw-in for users who are attracted to organisations with humanitarian aims.
      <figure>
				<img src="IMAGES/WEB/newsletter.png" alt="NEWSLETTER"/>  
        <figcaption> Newsletter and Footer with Link Buttons </figcaption>      
      </figure>
          Closer to the footer of the page is the subscribe for newsletter option box. According to Campaign Monitor’s (2020) survey, it reveals that 58% percent of their Gen Z respondents check their email multiple times a day and that Gen Z users remain as active email users. In addition, their survey goes on to look into the frequency of how often users liked to be emailed. For brands that users aligned themselves with, 31.8% of Gen Z respondents said they wanted to be emailed a couple times a week, whilst the next large group of 27.5% respondents responded with once a day. Including a newsletter subscription option allows users to keep in touch with the organisation, to be ready for any call to action.
          <br></br>
          The footer of the page includes icons that allow users to navigate from the web page to other related pages, such as the facebook page, primary website page or to their email client that allows the user to send direct inquiries to the organisation. This footer exists on every page, so that users would know where and can always head to other external links on any page of the website.
        <br></br>
      <h3 id="about">ABOUT</h3>
      <figure>
				<img src="IMAGES/WEB/about1.PNG" alt="ABOUT"/>    
        <figcaption>About Page, with embeded video, contact information and mission statement</figcaption>  
      </figure>
          The about page contains information related to the Pets For Life organisation. Such info includes mobile contact, what they do in specifics and mission statement. Engagement in video form is considered ideal to entertain and inform users (Gadimova, 2020) and an about video from Facebook is embedded into the page, for users to not only get a look around the shelter but meet the people in the organisation.
          Closer to the footer is an enquiry box, where users ask questions straight from the website.
      <figure>
        <img src="IMAGES/WEB/about2.PNG" alt="ABOUT2"/>
        <figcaption>Enquiry Box and Footer, with relevant fields. </figcaption>

        <br></br>
      <h3 id="donate">DONATE</h3>
      <figure>
				<img src="IMAGES/WEB/donate1.PNG" alt="DONATE"/> 
        <figcaption> </figcaption>      
      </figure>
          The donate page provides users to choose donation options. Giving them options in divided boxes, users can choose an amount to donate or donate a custom amount to the shelter and donate towards a goal, e.g. feeding a cat for a month or assisting operation costs.
      <figure>
        <img src="IMAGES/WEB/tiers.png" alt="TIERS"/>  
        <figcaption>Within the donate page, users can interact with sections, providing different options for users to choose. </figcaption>    
      </figure>
          In this current version of the website, each option leads to the donation page on the main website. Future iterations could lead to a page where users can choose or adjust donation options before being led to a checkout or paypal page where the transaction can be finalised.
        <br></br>
      <h3 id="volunteer">VOLUNTEER</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="IMAGES/WEB/volunteer1.PNG" alt="VOLUNTEER"/>
      </figure>
          A page that can be reached via interacting with the banner or the top navigation bar, the volunteer page acts as the main purpose of the website. It lays out responsibilities and requirements for users to consider before users make the decision to volunteer. With a simple button, the users are taken to an online form to fill out via the “Sign Me Up” Button.
        <br></br>
      <h3 id="volunteerform">VOLUNTEER FORM</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="IMAGES/WEB/volunteerform1.PNG" alt="FORM"/>   
        <figcaption> Example of the fields in the form. It includes, not limited to: Name, DOB, Email. It also include checklist options and text boxes. </figcaption>    
      </figure>
        The Volunteer form page is a web form that users can fill out on the website. Myerson (2020) explains the format of a form is more attractive, compared to the act of calling up which is seemingly daunting for potential younger volunteers. In creating an online form streamlines the application process and makes it easier for potential volunteers to sign up and help.
        The fields were based on the fields found in the organisation’s application pdf form.
